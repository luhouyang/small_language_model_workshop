## Simplest Neural Network

A simple implementation of neural network using only the numpy package. Instructions are found in [instruction.md](src/history_of_ai/instruction.md)

## Basic AI Modeling

The steps that all AI training needs, basics, AI modeling 101. Instructions are found in [instruction.md](src/language_models/src/instruction.md)

## Scaling Law

See the scaling law in action. Instructions are found in [instruction.md](src/language_models/src/instruction.md)

## microGPT

Study the elegant code by Andrej Karpathy, a GPT model in 200 lines built with Python basic libraries. Code is found in [microgpt.py](src/language_models/8627fe009c40f57531cb18360106ce95/microgpt.py)

## Small Language Models


### Ollama + Telegram

Use Ollama and Telegram to build a simple python program. Instructions are found in [instruction.md](src/language_models/ollama/instruction.md)

### LangChain Novelist

Is this a business oppurtunity (OoO) Instructions are found in [instruction.md](src/language_models/langchain/instruction.md)
